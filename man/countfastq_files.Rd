Wrapper for applying the countfastq() function to a vector of filenames using multiple threads.
Returns a dataframe with read counts and base counts for each input fastq file.
Caveat: Input fastq file must have exactly four lines per sequence. If your fastq files do not fit this criterion, you are totally bonkers.}
